RPS battle system



-Basic Idea-
	-players play a generalized version of Rock Paper Scissors
	-instead of a discrete choice between rock(1,0,0), paper(0,1,0), and scissors(0,0,1), the player chooses any normalized 3-vector: (r,p,s)
	-The RPS vectors of the two players are compared, and the winner is determined
	-players make their choice of vector by orienting a sphere



-Other Features/Ideas
	-The game is live, rather than turn based-
		-each player has a trigger to 'attack', forcing a comparison of RPS vectors
	-Continuous scoring-
		-points are float-valued, determined by outcome of vector comparison
	-Discrete scoring-
		-points are integer valued, with pre-defined ranges for vector comparison output
		-e.g. 0 points: 0.0-0.5, 1 point: 0.5-0.9, 2 points, 0.9-1.0
	-AI-
		-It would be quite fun to try to write an optimal AI for this game
	-Separate attack/defense-  SAFE ZONES MAKE THIS A BAD IDEA
		-each player controls two independent spheres: one for attack, one for defense
		-points can only be scored by attacking
		-the attacking player's attack vector is compared against the defending player's defense vector
	-angular momentum-
		-the spheres conserve angular momentum
		-players control sphere orientation through application of torque
		-there should probably be some small friction applied
		-also, perhaps a "brake" key, to significantly increase friction







-Potential Applications-
	-GAME: Co-Pilot-
		-A minimalist space dogfight game (could be limited to 1vAI or 1v1), perhaps set in an asteroid field (something like Frontier)
		-The pilot flies the ship, just as in Frontier
		-The co-pilot controls the ships laser frequency and shield frequency using the RPS sphere system
		-Which player should control the laser aiming/trigger? probably the pilot

	-more details:
		-co-pilot controls only one RPS sphere
		-ship lasers fire only straight forward
		-therefore, pilot must aim lasers
		-On the co-pilot HUD (the RPS sphere):
			-numbered targeting dots for each enemy ship in the forward FOV
			-damage dots for each laser currently impacting the shields
			-pilot and copilot must communicate and coordinate which enemy to target next
		-shield spectrum and laser spectrum are identical
		-therefore, you can sit at the safe points and have impervious shield, but your lasers won't do any damage

	-alternatively: 3 crew:
		-pilot (only pilots the ship)
		-gunner (aims the lasers)
		-tuner (tunes the laser and shield frequencies)
